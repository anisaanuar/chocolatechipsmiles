        <p id="pagetext"><b>Sometimes I feel like the hardest thing to do in life is tell someone about myself.</b>. 
        <p id="pagetext">Thankfully, I made a video.</p>
        <p id="video"><iframe width="600" height="450" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BulV0yzhldc"></iframe></p>
        <p id="pagetext">Every time I write a description of myself, I say something different. It’s not that I change with each new project– I just have something new to say each time. I look at myself differently depending on the situation. My resume? I write about myself in terms of academics and professionalism. My Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram profiles? One(-or-so)-liners that summarize my interests, each one about something different:</p>
        <p id="pagetext"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/anisaanuar">Facebook</a>: A junior at ESUMS with an interest in mathematics, physics, spoken word poetry, and making the world a better place for the people I care about.</p>
        <p id="pagetext"><a href="http://instagram.com/chocolatechipsmiles/">Instagram</a>: 7/18/98. ESUMS. Sixteen. Junior. MalAySIAN. Undercover baker, writer, geek. [superwhomerlockian, collar, psycho, etc.] Selfies | Cookies | Kitties | +</p>
        <p id="pagetext"><a href="http://www.twitter.com/neesaonline">Twitter</a>: I don’t wanna be in love.</p>
        <p id="pagetext">On Facebook, I tell people who I am and why they should get to know me. On Instagram, I tell potential followers what they should look forward to in my posts. On Twitter, since my posts are visible, I simply put a lyric from a song that basically says, if you get this reference, we are friends. Each social media network has a different description has a different purpose.</p>
        <p id="pagetext">But what for my portfolio? A general overview of basically everything. Who am I? Why should you care? What about me should keep you coming back for more?</p><p id="pagetext">I suppose that I don't really care right now, as I am not going to take the time to write any description out.</p>
