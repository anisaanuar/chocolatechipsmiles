        <p id="pagetext"><span style="font-style: italic">“We are all apprentices in a craft where no one ever becomes a master.”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">—Ernest Hemingway</span><hr></p><p id="pagetext">I write. Poetry, fiction, personal narratives, everything and anything. I almost created this entire site without one trace of my written works. Can you imagine what it would’ve been like? After all, most of what makes me who I am is expressed not in chemistry assignments or business plans, but in my stories and poems and essays.</p><p id="pagetext">So here they are.</p><p id="pagetext"><b>POETRY SLAMS</b></p><p id="pagetext">I have participated in several poetry slams. I didn’t make it past the first round in my first one, I tied for first the second one, and I won the next one. (Although it was announced that I got second place. But it really doesn’t matter. Being second is good enough for me– in the end, people still got to hear what I had to say.)</p><p id="pagetext">I learned a lot throughout my life as a writer and as a poet. From my first poetry slam, I learned that <b>confidence is essential, but overconfidence is detrimental</b>. I spoke very confidently and dressed boldly. However, my content did not match my tone, and therefore my score wasn’t as high as it could’ve been had I been more hushed or expressive.</p><p id="pagetext">This is the poem I read at the first poetry slam. (Beautiful Psychopath)</p><p id="pagetext">At the second poetry slam, most of what I learned was that <b><i>tears get points</i></b>. If you cry, you’re pretty much set to move on to the next round, even if you’re crying about something that has nothing to do with you. Also, relatable poems are great, but <b>memorization is key</b>. Had I memorized my last poem and moved around more, I would’ve probably won.</p><p id="pagetext">Here are the poems I read at the second poetry slam. (FIRST: <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/254241304/Eight-Years-Old">Eight Years Old</a> || SECOND: To My Mother || THIRD: <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/254241303/A-List-of-Things-I-Have-Found-in-Walmart">A List of Things I Found at Walmart</a>)</p><p id="pagetext">At the third and most recent poetry slam, I learned that content is important, but you should only <b>write to express what you want to say</b>. At this slam, I read mainly poems about a person who was my main inspiration for poetry at the time. Although I did win, I do wish I had written more about me than him.</p><p id="pagetext">Here are the poems I read at the second poetry slam. (FIRST: Time Machine || SECOND: Ode to You || THIRD: I Have a Problem)</p><p id="pagetext"><b>WRITTEN POETRY</b></p><p id="pagetext">Although most of my poetry is written with the intent of being performed, there are some that haven’t yet made it to the stage.</p><p id="pagetext"><b>SHORT STORIES</b></p><p id="pagetext">Random nonsense that I scribble into plotlines and awesomeness.</p><p id="pagetext"><b>PERSONAL NARRATIVES</b></p><p id="pagetext">Although I do not have many of these, I do have a couple. Most are incomplete, but then again, so is my life.</p>
