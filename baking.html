        <p id="pagetext">As a student of a college preparatory magnet school specializing in engineering and science, it would only seem fitting that I would follow a career path under one of those two subjects. However, I’m more of a mathematics student myself, and believe that engineering and science are still two very important topics that I’d do well to study thoroughly.</p><p id="pagetext">However, although it seems as though I’d specialize in anything or only things strictly related to STEM, I, like many of the other students at ESUMS, have interests outside of school and outside of science, engineering, mathematics, or sometimes even technology.</p><p id="pagetext">While most of my peers are interested in technological arts such as film-making or 3D-modeling, and some are interested in more traditional arts such as painting or dancing, I associate myself more with the <i>culinary arts.</i></p><p id="pagetext"><iframe width="480" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3xEkt-iim9s"></iframe></p><p id="pagetext">I love to bake, and there’s no other way to put it. I do wish I had less of an obligation to do chemistry problems or statistics homework and more time to experiment with chocolate fudge-cookie dough-brownies, but I’m able to sort out my priorities and get both done in periods of satisfaction. For example, over the summer, I baked as often as I could, in order to prepare for the hiatus I’d take once the school year started and I’d have classes, clubs, and extracurricular activities to attend to. However, as the school year progresses, I will fit baking into my studies, whether it be baking cookies to fundraise for student government or decorating cupcakes for poetry club, and I’ll be able to have my cake and eat it too (pun not intended).</p><p id="pagetext">Aside from baking as a hobby (although I see it as more of a commitment, but maybe that’s just me), I sometimes make YouTube videos– mainly of me baking.</p><p id="pagetext"><iframe width="480" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Yx0H9tMD_DQ"></iframe></p><p id="pagetext">I generally only bake during special occasions, like birthdays or celebrations. My most favorite creations include a cake I made for my friend who loves Oreos and Batman, a cake for a friend who I think is super beautiful, and little Baymax pops I made with my Big Hero 6-loving friend.</p><p id="pagetext"><iframe src="http://www.instagram.com/p/3xtosZOMdq/embed/" width="306" height="355" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe><iframe src="http://www.instagram.com/p/sOKFIPOMeq/embed/" width="306" height="355" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe><iframe src="http://www.instagram.com/p/1iqF2ouMau/embed/" width="306" height="355" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p><p id="pagetext">But overall, I bake anything and everything and stuff.</p>
