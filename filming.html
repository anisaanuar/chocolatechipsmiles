        <p id="pagetext">It all started with a project for AP Language & Composition class.</p><p id="pagetext"><iframe width="480" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/zZ8GtnSwPqg"></iframe></p><p id="pagetext">For the longest time, I always tried hard to avoid camera lens of all kinds.</p><p id="pagetext">Whether it be my mother taking pictures with her small red camera or my father taking videos with his iPhone, I would be ducking in and out of empty spaces to make sure that my face isn't caught in any frame.</p><p id="pagetext"></p><p id="pagetext">Perhaps it is for this reason that I chose to start filming.</p><p id="pagetext">As the saying goes, "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em." And so I did.</p><p id="pagetext">I started to plant myself on the other side of the lens. I would experiment with different types of cameras; my friends were a great resource for this, as I could never afford my own camera. And ultimately, I imported media from my phone or my dad's video camera (and some times even just YouTube) and just began to place them together in some way that flows using whatever video editor was pre-installed as a default on my laptop.</p><p id="pagetext">In fact, some of my videos actually don't contain any footage obtained by myself at all.</p><p id="pagetext"><iframe width="480" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xqbdKXlTxXY"></iframe></p><p id="pagetext">But most of my videos are all about me. Like my introduction video on <a href="about.html">my about page</a>!</p><p id="pagetext">One of my more recently-made videos in particular is a result of intense teamwork. During my three-week program at Stanford University, we were assigned a project to research some scientific invention and write a paper and deliver a multimedia presentation on it.</p><p id="pagetext">Instead of writing a paper, though, I chose to make a video. (It's okay, this was allowed!)</p><p id="pagetext"><iframe width="480" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XHaC0nDMFqM"></iframe></p><p id="pagetext">Thanks to my amazing classmates, I was able to finish this film (for the most part) in a matter of days, although the process was slightly stressful.</p><p id="pagetext">Behind the Scenes video goes here.</p><p id="pagetext">Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/neesaonline/">here</a> to head to my channel and see the rest of the videos I made!</p><p id="pagetext">
